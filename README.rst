|Build Status|

django-progressbarupload is a simple Django application that
instantiates an HTML5 upload progress bar when the user submits a form
with files (a form having basically FileField(s) and/or ImageField(s),
and an enctype="multipart/form-data").

    class MyAwesomeModelWithFiles(admin.ModelAdmin):
        change_form_template = 'progressbarupload/change_form.html'
        add_form_template = 'progressbarupload/change_form.html'

    admin.site.register(MyAwesomeModelWithFiles, UploadFileModelAdmin)

Demo
----

This app includes a demo app, just go inside testapp dir and run

::

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver

then go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin or http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

http://127.0.0.1:8000/testapp/modelform

Form and ModelForm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use a progress bar in your custom ModelForm or Form, load the
progress\_bar template tag set ``{% load progress_bar %}`` in the
template, and use the following template tags
``{% progress_bar_media %}`` between

.. raw:: html

   <head>

tags to load javascript files and ``{% progress_bar %}`` where you and
to display the progress bar.

.. code:: django

    {% load progress_bar %}

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        {% progress_bar_media %}
    </head>

    <body>
      <form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" action=".">
         {% csrf_token %}
         {{ form }}
         {% progress_bar %}
         <input type="submit" />
     </form>
    </body>
    </html>

Further information
-------------------

Make sure your browser renders HTML5 ``<progress>`` tag and uses data-\*
attribute (IE>10, FF>6.0, Chrome>8.0, Opera>11.0).

As Django has a unique TemporaryFileUploadHandler for all request.FILES.
For ModelAdmin, if you have related models, using TabularInline, the
upload progress will also be shown in the admin add/change form as soon
as you use the right templates in your ModelAdmin (and even if your
ModelAdmin doesn't contain any file upload).

Custom TemporaryFileUploadHandler copied from
http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/678/

Launch tests
------------

It assumes you have installed virtualenvwrapper
(http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

.. code:: bash

    # get the application code
    git clone https://github.com/ouhouhsami/django-progressbarupload.git
    cd django-progressbarupload
    # create a virtualenv
    mkvirtualenv progressbarupload
    add2virtualenv .
    # install requirements for tests and django (set the django version you want to use)
    pip install -r requirements/tests.txt django==1.7.4
    # launch tests
    django-admin.py test --settings=progressbarupload.test_settings progressbarupload

New: Use transparently with uwsgi/nginx
--------------------------------------- 

The combination of uwsgi andnginx prevent django-progressbarupload from 
working because nginx buffers the entire POST request until it is complete 
before sending it to uwsgi/django. This means your application runs faster 
as uwsgi threads are less tied up, but it also makes it impossible to view to
progress Django side.

Whilst you could use XMLHttpRequest 2.0 to get the progress client-side,
you may not have the luxury if you need to support older browsers. This
is where `RFC1867 <http://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc1867>`__ comes in. By
configuring the
`nginx-upload-progress-module <https://github.com/masterzen/nginx-upload-progress-module>`__
in the following way, it is possible to transparently support the native
method as well as the plugin:

.. code:: nginx

        
        upload_progress uploadp 1m;
        
        # JSON document rather than JSONP callback, pls
        upload_progress_json_output;
        
        location ^ upload/url/pattern/
            track_uploads uploadp 30s {
        }
        
        location ^~ /progressbarupload/upload_progress {
            report_uploads uploadp;
        }

nginx-upload-progress-module is available on ubuntu in the
``nginx-extras`` package.
